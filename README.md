# **🚀 SkillNexa AI (ChatBot Mentor) – Principal Tech Oracle:**

🎓 SkillNexa AI is an advanced Streamlit-based Generative AI mentoring platform that simulates interactions with a Principal-level Software Engineer across multiple technical domains such as Python, SQL, MLOps, Generative AI, Deep Learning, and Agentic AI.

It leverages Google Gemini (via LangChain) to deliver context-aware, mentor-style responses in a futuristic, highly interactive UI.

## 🎯 Project Overview & Motivation

Modern learners often struggle to access personalized, senior-level technical guidance while navigating advanced domains such as Generative AI, MLOps, and Agentic AI. Most learning platforms focus on generic     explanations rather than real-world engineering mentorship.

SkillNexa AI was designed to bridge this gap by simulating the experience of learning directly from a Principal Software Engineer, available anytime and tailored to specific technical domains.

The objective goes beyond answering questions. SkillNexa AI aims to mentor, guide, and build learner confidence by delivering clear, practical, and production-oriented insights—replicating how experienced        industry professionals teach, review, and advise in real-world environments.
